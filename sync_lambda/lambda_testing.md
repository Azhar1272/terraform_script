# Lambda testing scenerios 

**1. New table creation and new snowpipe creation**

| Scenario                                         | Status                                          | Details                                         |

| Create new table in source |  âœ… | No change , lambda or snowpipe gets triggered only when new file is added to s3|
| Add records to the table |  âœ…    | New file is added to S3 by DMS . When lambda is executed, new table and snowpipe is created in uppercase |
| Add new records |  âœ…    | Snowpipe automatically adds the data to snowflake table with Op as 'I' |
| Delete records |  âœ…    | Snowpipe automatically adds the data to snowflake table with Op as 'D' |
| Update records |  âœ…    | Snowpipe automatically adds the data to snowflake table with Op as 'U' |

| Delete the snowpipe when columns are deleted from source schem             |  ðŸ”´                   |When the snowpipe is deleted , the new snowpipe create or replace tries to get executed and errors out since the column count is not matching with the table|
| Create a snowpipe with lowercase to test the negative test case | ðŸ”´ | It fails because the number of columns does not match with table and snowpipe create or replace statement |

**6.Delete the table or case sensitive change - To test the negative scenerio**
| Scenario                                         | Status                                          | Details                                         |
